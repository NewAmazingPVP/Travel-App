      <li>The Forbidden City</li>
      <p>The Forbidden City is supposed to give off the impression that it resembles great imperial power(s). The Ming Dynasty used the palace for many different </br>
      reasons. Such as housing/meeting places for politicans, showing off the emperors power; it was also a ritual center for guests to practice to their population. </br>
      Many Chinese have said that it was the center of the heavens, which resembled the highest point in the sky and signifying the emperor's divine as the "Son of</br>
      Heaven."
      <li>Tiananmen Square</li>
      <p>Despite Chinese citizens living under a communist government, there are many civilians that disapprove on how politicans are running the country. In 1989, </br>
      a series of protests had occured in Tiananmen Square after popular pro-reform Chinese leader "Hu Yaobang" had suddenly past. The government wanted to disguise it </br>
      as a coincidence, but citizens didn't take it lightly. Hu Yaobang was popular among the Chinese people, doing his best to address injustice, support economic reforms, </br>
      and aimed to modernize China. As a sign of protest, many Chinese citizens gathered in Tiananmen Square protesting against their corrupt government and acknowledging </br>
      the voice and opinions of the citizens. One man was even brave enough to stand in front of a moving tank to prevent it from moving forward. Though many citizens were </br>
      killed and injured, Tianamen Square symbolizes Chinese fighting for their freedom.
