    <h2>Khartoum</h2>
      <p>Khartoum is the meeting point of the Blue and White Nile river. It was originally an Egyptian army camp in 1821 to help rebell against the British. The capital </br>
      was reoccupied in 1898, rebuilt by the new Sudanese govenor who went by the name of "Lord Kitchener" and was a huge contributor to making Khartoum became the </br>
      the independent capital of Sudan. Due to all this, Khartoum offers many musesums to help foreigners to explore its rich history, souq's for shopping clothes, food, </br>
      and other goods.
